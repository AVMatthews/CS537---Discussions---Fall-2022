ell which is which if they are the same??? The child process will get the return value 0 from `fork` while the parent will get the child's pid as the return value.

```C
pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) { // the child process will execute this
    printf("I am child with pid %d. I got return value from fork: %d\n", getpid(), pid);
        exit(0); // we exit here so the child process will not keep running
	} else { // the parent process will execute this
	    printf("I am parent with pid %d. I got return value from fork: %d\n", getpid(), pid);
	    }
	    ```

You could find the code above in the repo as `fork_example.c`. After executing it, you will see output like this:

```console
$ ./fork_example
I am parent with pid 46565. I got return value from fork: 46566
I am child with pid 46566. I got return value from fork: 0
```
### `exec`:

`fork` itself is not sufficient to run an operating system. It can only create a copy of the previous program, but we don't want the exact same program all the time. That's when `exec` shines. `exec` is actually a family of functions, including `execve`, `execl`, `execle`, `execlp`, `execv`, `execvp`, `execvP`... The key one is `execve` (which is the actual syscall) and the rest of them are just some wrappers in the glibc that does some work and then calls `execve`. For this project, `execv` is probably what you need. It is slightly less powerful than `execve`, but is enough for this project.

What `exec` does is: it accepts a path/filename and finds this file. If it is an executable file, it then destroys the current address space (including code, stack, heap, etc), loads in the new code, and starts executing the new code.

```C
int execv(const char *path, char *const argv[])
```

Here is how `execv` works: it takes a first argument `path` to specify where the executable file locates, and then provides the command-line arguments `argv`, which will eventually become what the target program receives in their main function `int main(int argc, char* argv[])`.

```C
pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) {
    // the child process will execute this
        char *const argv[3] = {
	        "/bin/ls", // string literial is of type "const char*"
		        "-l",
			        NULL // it must have a NULL in the end of argv
				    };
				        int ret = execv(argv[0], argv);
					    // if succeeds, execve should never return
					        // if it returns, it must fail (e.g. cannot find the executable file)
						    printf("Fails to execute %s\n", argv[0]);
						        exit(1);
							}
							// do parent's work
							```

You could find the code above in the repo as `exec_example.c`. After executing it, you will see output exactly like executing `ls -l`.

As the last word of this section, I strongly recommend you to read the [document](https://linux.die.net/man/3/execv) yourself to understand how it works.

### `waitpid`: Wait for child to finish

Now you know the shell is the parent of all the processes it creates. The next question is, when executing a command, the shell should suspend and not asking for new inputs until the child process finishes executing.

```console
$ sleep 10 # this will create a new process executing /usr/bin/sleep
```

The command above will create a child process that does nothing other than sleeping for 10 seconds. During this period, you may notice your shell is also not printing a new prompt. This is what the shell does: it waits until the child process to terminate (no matter voluntarily or not). If you use `ctrl-c` to terminate `sleep`, you should see the shell would print the prompt immediately.

This is also be done by a syscall `waitpid`:

```C
pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);
```

This syscall will suspend the parent process and resume again when the child is done. It takes three arguments: `pid`, a pointer to an int `status`, and some flags `options`. `pid` is the pid of the child that the parent wants to waiit. `status` is a pointer pointing a piece of memory that `waitpid` could write the status to. `options` allows you to configure when `waitpid` should return. By default (`options = 0`), it only returns when the child terminates. This should be sufficient for this project.

## Question : What's wrong with following code?

```C
// assume we know pid
int* status;
waitpid(pid, status, 0); // QUIZ: what is wrong?
```

`*status` will be filled in the status that `waitpid` returns. This allows you to have more info about what happens to the child. You could use some macro defined in the library to check it, e.g. `WIFEXITED(status)` is true if the child terminated normally (i.e. not killed by signals); `WEXITSTATUS(status)` could tell you what is the exit code from the child process (e.g. if the child `return 0` from the main function, `WEXITSTATUS(status)` will give you zero).

Again, you should read the [document](https://linux.die.net/man/2/waitpid) yourself carefully.

Putting what we have discussed together, you should now have some idea of the skeleton of the shell

```C
pid_t pid = fork(); // create a new child process
if (pid == 0) { // this is child
    // do some preparation
        execv(path, argv);
	    exit(1); // this means execv() fails
	    }
	    // parent
	    int status;
	    waitpid(pid, &status, 0); // wait the child to finish its work before keep going
	    // continue to handle the next command
	    ```

# Strings in C

## StrTok
The C library function char *strtok(char *str, const char *delim) breaks string str into a series of tokens using the delimiter delim.

```C
/* get the first token */
   token = strtok(str, delim);

   /* walk through other tokens */
      while( token != NULL ) {
            printf( " %s\n", token );

      token = strtok(NULL, delim);
         }
	 ```

## StrDup

The function strdup() is used to duplicate a string. It returns a pointer to null-terminated byte string.

```C
  copy_str = strdup(source_str);
  ```

## Debugging backslash zero - `\0`

Backslash zero may seem innocents but since memory management is taken care of by programmar in C, things can get a bit hectic.

Step 1 : Compile program for backslash zero

`make backslash`

Step 2 : Run it. Press enter key one by one to slowly browse though code while it spits out useful pointer related information.

`./backslash`

Step 3 : Run it with gdb to see string array.

`gdb backslash`

`run`

### Solution:

```C
// Demo of BackSlash 0 pitfalls.
int init_size = 10;
char *ptr = malloc( sizeof( char ) * init_size);
//Assume G is garbage because actual garbage in not printable on terminal.
memset(ptr , 'G' , init_size);
memset(ptr , 'A' , 7);
ptr[4] = '\0';
```
Now, because of this backslash 0 at index 4, all strings related functions will have trouble in operating on ptr because they expect `'\0'` to be properly inserted.
```C
printf("Length of string %s is %ld ..... but ptr[%d] = %c \n" , ptr ,  strlen(ptr) , 5 , ptr[5]);
printf("Similarly ptr[%d] = %c \n" , 6 , ptr[6]);
printf("But ptr[%d] = %c ? \n" , 7 , ptr[7]);
```

Although, pointer has access to memory beyond `\0` but anything after '\0' is ignored by string manipulation functions. For example as per man page of **strcat**,

_The strcat() function appends the src string to the dest string,
overwriting the terminating null byte (`\0`) at the end of dest,
and then adds a terminating null byte._

```C
char append[] = "BBBB";
strcat(ptr , append);
printf("After append string %s's length is %ld \n" , ptr ,  strlen(ptr) );
printf("So, ptr[%d] is still %c \n" , 9 ,  ptr[9]);
```~
